# Repository for showcasing small HTML/CSS/JS experiments

I do a lot of testing and experimenting. Typically, I delete them after I'm done. Here I will collect them.

## Experiments included:

1. Matrix display experiment [https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/1/index.html](https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/1/index.html)
2. ResizeObserver experiment [https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/2/index.html](https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/2/index.html)
3. Size dependent SVG generator [https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/3/index.html](https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/3/index.html)
4. Symbols with resizeObserver [https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/4/index.html](https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/4/index.html)
5. Position: absolute [https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/5/index.html](https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/5/index.html)
6. Better svg constructions [https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/6/index.html](https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/6/index.html)
7. float: left breaks box model in display: inline-block [https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/7/index.html](https://niurop.github.io/expo/expo/6/index.html)

## Planned experiments:

- optimizing cash usage for symbols (removing unused)
- disabling new lines in contenteditable
- creating templates for positioning elements in math equations
- creating a nice interface for extending tables
- creating template XML structures
- connecting logical AST to UI-AST elements
- creating a tree view of AST
- connecting tree view to UI-AST
- selecting multiple UI-AST elements
- drag&drop functionality for UI-AST
- creating select menus for UI-AST
- rule based select menus for UI-AST
- rule based select drag&drop for UI-AST
- create abstraction over dynamic programming
- test css optimizations for runtime generated svgs
- good quality svgs for typesetting
- by hand positioning system using css variables
- box model for displaying symbols
